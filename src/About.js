						<h2>How it started</h2>
						<p>"Fast food nowadays is great and all, but it would be better if it was healthier". Those were the words of Brian Levitsky, the founder of GoodEats®.</p>
						<p>Brian was a young man who had just finished college. He was struggling to find out what he wanted to do with his life. He would often go to local fast food paces to think about his future.</p>
						<p>Then he had a thought. What if he had opened his very own chain of fast food restaurants? What if they used fresh ingredients without any processed food? And so GoodEats® was born.</p>

						<h2>How it's going</h2>
						<p>Since it's creation, GoodEats® has grown over the recent years and has now become one of the most beloved fast food chains around the globe, with many calling it the best fast food chain around.</p>
